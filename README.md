# Project Aristotle

**TUI-based markdown knowledge system with semantic search and chunk-level navigation.**

A Rust-based personal knowledge management tool that operates on plain Markdown folder trees. Aristotle is structurally and operationally unopinionated, striving to be as easy to use as Sublime Text, while leveraging powerful AI associativity and search tools. It uses HNSW for semantic vector search and Tantivy for full-text search. The TUI supports editing, SSH access, and similarity-based navigation across sentence- or paragraph-level semantic chunks. Future extensions include an HTTP API and web interface. This project also serves as a proving ground for techniques that will enhance Gluon performance.
